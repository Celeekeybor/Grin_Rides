### Where Joy Meets the Road (Our ALX Portfolio project)

GrinRides App is a ridesharing application that provides drivers with the ability to create ride oﬀers  and passengers to join available ride oﬀers.

## Overview

another or users that are driving a trip and want to find passengers. Users can act as both passengers and 
drivers while using an application

his trip on the application in order to find passengers to share the ride with.
